(* As you are defining the semantics, there is not much that can be checked

* tasks here so that those who do not wish to look at them don't need to:

- exec: 10%
- hoare_triple: 10%
- hoare_triple_big_step: 10%
- add_two_inputs_ok: 10%
- max3_ok: 10%
- fibonacci_ok:
  - 10% for inductive invariant
  - 10% for proof
- your program:
  - 10% for spec
  - 20% for proof
