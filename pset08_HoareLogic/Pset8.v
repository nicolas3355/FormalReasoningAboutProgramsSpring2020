(** * Hoare Logic with Input/Output Traces *)

(* Hoare logic as covered in lecture is only the beginning, so far as
 * programming features that can be supported. In this problem set, we
 * will implement one of variant, a Hoare logic that deals with
 * input/output traces.
 *
 * Behaviors of a program can be defined as sequences of communications with
 * the outside world. Hoare logic certainly can be used for proving properties
 * about program behaviors. Besides valuation and heap, we will need to keep
 * track of traces of a program to ensure the properties we want, sometimes by
 * proving invariants in the middle of the program.
 *
 * The problem set consists of 4 tasks; basically we ask you to formally prove 
 * the correctness of some programs using Hoare logic:
 * 1) To design a big-step operational semantics of the given language.
 * 2) To define a Hoare logic for the language, and to prove the consistency
 *    between the semantics and the logic.
 * 3) To verify three example programs we provide, using Hoare logic.
 * 4) To design your own program and to verify it.
 *)

(** * Language syntax *)

(* There is nothing special with the definitions of [exp] and [bexp]; they are
 * exactly same as we've seen in the lecture.
 *)
Inductive exp :=
| Const (n : nat)
| Var (x : string)
| Read (e1 : exp)
| Plus (e1 e2 : exp)
| Minus (e1 e2 : exp)
| Mult (e1 e2 : exp).

Inductive bexp :=
| Equal (e1 e2 : exp)
| Less (e1 e2 : exp).

(* [heap] and [valuation] are also as usual. *)
Definition heap := fmap nat nat.
Definition valuation := fmap var nat.

(* Besides [heap] and [valuation], we have one more component to verify using 
 * Hoare logic, called [io]. We keep track of inputs and outputs of a certain
 * program, regarding them as meaningful communication with the outside world.
 * When a program is executed, it generates [trace], which is a list of [io]s,
 * meaning inputs and outputs that occurred during the execution. Traces are
 * also called behaviors of a program.
 *)
Inductive io := In (v : nat) | Out (v : nat).
Definition trace := list io.

(* We now have two types of assertions: [iassertion] is used only for asserting 
 * properties of internal states. [assertion] can be used for asserting 
 * properties of [trace]s as well as internal states.
 *)
Definition iassertion := heap -> valuation -> Prop.
Definition assertion := trace -> heap -> valuation -> Prop.

(* [cmd] has more constructors than what we've seen.  The new ones are called
 * [Input] and [Output]. As expected, semantically they generates [io]s,
 * eventually forming a [trace] of a program.
 *)
Inductive cmd :=
| Skip
| Assign (x : var) (e : exp)
| Write (e1 e2 : exp)
| Seq (c1 c2 : cmd)
| If_ (be : bexp) (then_ else_ : cmd)
| While_ (inv : assertion) (be : bexp) (body : cmd)

| Assert (a : iassertion) (* Note that we are using [iassertion], not 
                           * [assertion], for [Assert]. While [valuation] and
                           * [heap] are internal states directly manipulated by
                           * a program, [trace] is rather an abstract notion for
                           * defining a behavior of a program.
                           *)

(* The new constructors are below! *)
| Input (x : var) (* [Input] takes an input from the external world and assigns
                   * the value to the local variable [x].
                   *)
| Output (e : exp). (* [Output] prints the value of [e]. *)

(** * Task 1: A big-step operational semantics for commands *)

(* Your first task is to define a big-step operational semantics for commands.
 * While it should be very similar to what we've seen in class, it should
 * also represent something about [io]s (or [trace]). Make sure the semantics
 * captures the effects of [Input]/[Output] on [trace]s. The most
 * recent event should appear at the *front* of the list in the trace.
 *
 * We provide the signature of the big-step semantics below. Replace the
 * [Axiom] below with your own definition of the semantics.
 * The first three arguments are the trace, heap, and valuation before execution,
 * and the final three arguments are the trace, heap, and valuation after execution.

 * Again, the task for this pset is to *extend* the framework from
 * frap/HoareLogic.v, not to reinvent it. In particular, if you are
 * having trouble with a construct other than input or output, the
 * basic version should be able to help you out.

(* The logic should be consistent with the semantics you defined, so we

 * semantics.  You will need this consistency to prove the correctness of
 * example programs we will provide soon.

(** * Task 4-3: Implement your own program to verify. *)

(* The last task is to implement your own program and to verify its correctness
