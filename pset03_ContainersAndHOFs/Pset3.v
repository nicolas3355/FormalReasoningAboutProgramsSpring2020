(* In this pset, we will practice two topics:
   1) Polymorphic container types, i.e. types which are parametrized by a
      type, such as "option A", "list A", "tree A", and finally, "binary_trie A",
      which combines option and tree to obtain a new useful data structure.
   2) Higher-order functions (HOFs), i.e. functions which take other functions
      as arguments.
*)

(* Each of the exercises below is worth some number of points.
   If you just want to enjoy the proof hacking without getting distracted by points,
   feel free to ignore these points. On the other hand, if you want to know how
   many points each exercise earns you, you can find the points in Pset3Sig.v. *)


(** ****** Polymorphic container types ****** *)

(* First, we'll reproduce some definitions we need from Lecture 2,
   [tree] and [flatten]: *)

Inductive tree {A} :=
| Leaf
| Node (l : tree) (d : A) (r : tree).
Arguments tree : clear implicits.

Fixpoint flatten {A} (t : tree A) : list A :=
  match t with
  | Leaf => []
  | Node l d r => flatten l ++ d :: flatten r
  end.

(* And here's one additional definition that we'll use in this problem set.
 * [either] combines two [option] values into one.
 * If either argument to [either] is a [Some], then so is
 * the result of the [either], preferring the contents of
 * the first argument if both are [Some].
 *
 * We will observe an "analogy" between the [either]
 * function on options and the [++] function on lists.
 *)
Definition either {A} (xo yo : option A) : option A :=
  match xo with
  | None => yo
  | Some x => Some x
  end.

(* If we [either] an [option] value with [None]
 * on the right, it leaves that value unchanged,
 * (just as if we put the [None] on the left).
 * This is analogous to how appending [nil]
 * on either side of a list leaves it unchanged.
 *)
Theorem either_None_right : forall {A} (xo : option A),
    either xo None = xo.
Proof.
  simplify.
  cases xo; equality.
Qed.

(* [either] is associative, just like [++]. *)
Theorem either_assoc : forall {A} (xo yo zo : option A),
    either (either xo yo) zo = either xo (either yo zo).
Proof.
  simplify.
  cases xo; cases yo; equality.
Qed.

(* [head] should compute the head of a list, that is,
 * it should return [Some] with the first element of
 * the list if the list is nonempty, and [None]
 * if the list is empty.
 *)
Definition head {A} (xs : list A) : option A :=
  match xs with
  | [] => None
  | x :: _ => Some x
  end.

Example head_example : head [1; 2; 3] = Some 1.
Proof.
  equality.
Qed.

(* The following theorem makes a formal connection
 * between [either] and [++].
 *)
Theorem either_app_head : forall {A} (xs ys : list A),
    head (xs ++ ys) = either (head xs) (head ys).
Proof.
  simplify.
  cases xs; try equality.
Qed.


(* [leftmost_Node] should compute the leftmost node of
 * a tree.
 *
 * Please implement [leftmost_Node] directly using
 * recursion (i.e., pattern matching) on the [tree] argument,
 * without using the [flatten] operation.
 *)
Fixpoint leftmost_Node {A} (t : tree A) : option A :=
  match t with
  | Leaf => None
  | Node Leaf d _ => Some d
  | Node l _ _ => leftmost_Node l
  end.  

Example leftmost_Node_example :
    leftmost_Node (Node (Node Leaf 2 (Node Leaf 3 Leaf)) 1 Leaf)
    = Some 2.
Proof.
  equality.
Qed.

(* Lemma f : forall A l (d : A) r, length(flatten (Node l d r)) > 0.
Proof.
  simplify.
Admitted.
*)
Lemma flatten_Node_Non_empty : forall A l  (d : A) r , exists x xs,
  (flatten (Node l d r)) = x :: xs.
Proof.
 simplify.
 cases l; simplify; try equality.
 + eauto. 
 + cases ((flatten l1 ++ d0 :: flatten l2)); simplify; eauto.
Qed.

(* Prove that the leftmost node of the tree is the same
 * as the head of the list produced by flattening the tree
 * with an in-order traversal.
 *)
Theorem leftmost_Node_head : forall {A} (t : tree A),
    leftmost_Node t = head (flatten t).
Proof.
  simplify.
  induct t; simplify; try equality.
  cases t1; try equality.
  rewrite IHt1.
  destruct flatten_Node_Non_empty with (A := A) (l := t1_1) (d := d0) (r := t1_2).
  destruct H.
  rewrite H.
  equality.
Qed.


(* A binary trie is a finite map keyed by lists of Booleans.
 * We will implement a binary trie with entries of type [A]
 * by [tree (option A)]. The value at the root of the tree
 * corresponds to the entry for the key [nil : list bool],
 * the left subtree contains entries for those keys that
 * begin with [true], and the right subtree contains entries
 * for those keys that begin with [false].
 *)
Definition binary_trie A := tree (option A).

(* Define [lookup] such that [lookup k t] looks up the
 * map entry corresponding to the key [k : list bool] in the
 * binary trie [t : binary_trie A], interpreting [t] such that
 * the value at the root of [t] corresponds to the
 * entry for the key [nil], the left subtree contains entries
 * for those keys that begin with [true], and the right subtree
 * contains entries for those keys that begin with [false].
 *)

Definition get_root {A} (t : binary_trie A) : option A :=
 match t with
 | Leaf => None
 | Node _ root _ => root
 end.

Definition get_left {A} (t : binary_trie A) : (binary_trie A) :=
 match t with
 | Leaf => Leaf
 | Node l _ _ => l
 end.

Definition get_right {A} (t : binary_trie A) : (binary_trie A) :=
 match t with
 | Leaf => Leaf
 | Node _ _ r => r
 end.

Fixpoint lookup {A} (k : list bool) (t : binary_trie A) {struct t} : option A:=
  match t with
  | Leaf => None   
  | Node l d r =>
      match k with
      | [] => get_root t
      | b :: ks => lookup ks (if b then l else r)
      end
  end.

Example lookup_example1 : lookup [] (Node Leaf (None : option nat) Leaf) = None.
Proof.
  equality.
Qed.

Example lookup_example2 : lookup [false; true]
    (Node (Node Leaf (Some 2) Leaf) None (Node (Node Leaf (Some 1) Leaf) (Some 3) Leaf))
                          = Some 1.
Proof.
  equality.
Qed.

(* [Leaf] represents an empty binary trie, so a lookup for
 * any key should return [None].
 *)
Theorem lookup_empty {A} (k : list bool)
  : lookup k (Leaf : binary_trie A) = None.
Proof.
  equality.
Qed.


(* Define an operation to "insert" a key and optional value
 * into a binary trie. The [insert] definition should satisfy two
 * properties: one is [lookup_insert] below, which says that if we
 * look up a key [k] in a trie where [(k, v)] has just been inserted,
 * the result should be [v]. The other is that lookups on keys different
 * from the one just inserted should be the same as on the original map.
 *
 * If an entry for that key already exists, [insert] should replace
 * that entry with the new one being inserted. Note that [insert] can
 * be used to remove an entry from the trie, too, by inserting [None]
 * as the value.
 *
 * Hint: it may be helpful to define an auxiliary function that inserts
 * a key and optional value into the empty trie.
 *)
Fixpoint insert {A} (k : list bool) (v : option A) (t : binary_trie A) {struct t}
  : binary_trie A. Admitted.

(** ****** Higher-order functions ****** *)

(* Recall the identity function [id] we used in class, which just returns its
   argument without modification: *)
Definition id {A : Type} (x : A) : A := x.

(* We also saw [compose], another higher-order function: [compose g f]
 * applies [f] to its input and then applies [g]. Argument order
 * follows the general convention of functional composition in
 * mathematics denoted by the small circle.
 *)
Definition compose {A B C : Type} (g : B -> C) (f : A -> B) (x : A) : C := g (f x).

(* Let's use a small circle to refer to [compose]. This will make our
   goals much more readable.
   It's up to you to decide whether you also want to use the circle notation
   in your definitions, or whether you prefer to write "compose". *)
Notation " g ∘ f " := (compose g f) (at level 40, left associativity).

(* Here are three simple properties of function composition. *)
Lemma compose_id_l : forall A B (f: A -> B),
    id ∘ f = f.
Proof.
Admitted.

Lemma compose_id_r : forall A B (f: A -> B),
    f ∘ id = f.
Proof.
Admitted.

Lemma compose_assoc : forall A B C D (f: A -> B) (g: B -> C) (h: C -> D),
    h ∘ (g ∘ f) = h ∘ g ∘ f.
Proof.
Admitted.

(* The selfCompose function takes a function and applies this function n times
   to the argument. There are different ways of defining it, but let's
   define it using only [id] and [compose]. *)
Fixpoint selfCompose{A: Type}(f: A -> A)(n: nat): A -> A :=
  match n with
  | O => id
  | S n' => f ∘ (selfCompose f n')
  end.

(* Here's an example of what [selfCompose] can do:
   If we apply the function which adds 2 to its argument 7 times to the starting
   value 3, we obtain 3 + 7 * 2 = 17. *)
Example selfCompose_plus1: selfCompose (plus 2) 7 3 = 17. Proof. equality. Qed.

(* We can also use [selfCompose] to define exponentiation on natural numbers, by
   saying "to raise [base] to the power [e], apply the function which multiplies
   its argument by [base] to [1] [e] times".
   Define [exp] using [selfCompose] and [Nat.mul]. *)
Definition exp(base e: nat): nat. Admitted.

(* Once you define [exp], you can replace [Admitted.] below by [Proof. equality. Qed.] *)
Lemma test_exp_2_3: exp 2 3 = 8. Admitted.
Lemma test_exp_3_2: exp 3 2 = 9. Admitted.
Lemma test_exp_4_1: exp 4 1 = 4. Admitted.
Lemma test_exp_5_0: exp 5 0 = 1. Admitted.
Lemma test_exp_1_3: exp 1 3 = 1. Admitted.

(* And here's another example to illustrate [selfCompose], make sure you understand
   why its result is 256. *)
Example selfCompose_square: selfCompose (fun (x: nat) => x * x) 3 2 = 256. Proof. equality. Qed.

(* If we map the [id] function over any list, we get the
 * same list back.
 *)
Theorem map_id : forall {A : Type} (xs : list A),
    map id xs = xs.
Proof.
Admitted.

(* If we map the composition of two functions over the list,
 * it's the same as mapping the first function over the whole list
 * and then mapping the second function over that resulting list.
 *)
Theorem map_compose : forall {A B C : Type} (g : B -> C) (f : A -> B) (xs : list A),
    map (g ∘ f) xs = map g (map f xs).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Just like we defined [map] for lists, we can similarly define
 * a higher-order function [tree_map] which applies a function on
 * elements to all of the elements in the tree, leaving the tree
 * structure intact.
 *)
Fixpoint tree_map {A B : Type} (f : A -> B) (t : tree A)
  : tree B. Admitted.

Example tree_map_example :
  tree_map (fun x => x + 1) (Node (Node Leaf 1 Leaf) 2 (Node Leaf 3 (Node Leaf 4 Leaf)))
  = (Node (Node Leaf 2 Leaf) 3 (Node Leaf 4 (Node Leaf 5 Leaf))).
Proof.
Admitted.

(* [tree_map_flatten] shows that [map]
 * and [tree_map] are related by the [flatten] function.
 *)
Theorem tree_map_flatten : forall {A B : Type} (f : A -> B) (t : tree A),
    flatten (tree_map f t) = map f (flatten t).
Proof.
Admitted.


(* *** Inverse functions *** *)

(* Using [compose] and [id], we can write a concise definition of when
   a function [g] is the inverse of a function [f]: *)
Definition inverse{A B: Type}(f: A -> B)(g: B -> A): Prop := g ∘ f = id.

(* Hint: In the following, it might be helpful to use the following fact:
   If two functions return the same value for all inputs, they are the same. *)
Check @FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality.
(* Aside: I called it a "fact" above, but logicians disagree about whether
   we should believe this or not -- maybe you remember Adam's argument from
   class that even if merge sort and bubble sort return the same result for
   all inputs, they are two different things.
   Therefore, this "fact" is not actually built into Coq's kernel, but it's
   an axiom written down in the standard library, and if you believe in it,
   you can import it (the Frap library already does so).
   In any case, it is consistent with the rest of Coq's logic, i.e. by
   assuming this axiom, you will not be able to prove False, so we're safe.*)

(* Let's make a shorthand for this: *)
Definition fun_ext := @FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality.

Ltac hammer := repeat (unfold inverse in * || unfold compose in *
                                           || unfold id in *
                                           || apply fun_ext
                                           || simplify

                                           || equality).

Ltac hammer' := repeat (hammer || propositional).

(* Here's an example: The function which subtracts two from its argument
   is the inverse of the function which adds two to its argument. *)
Example plus2minus2: inverse (fun (x: nat) => x + 2) (fun (x: nat) => x - 2).
Proof.

Qed.

Lemma fun_ext_rw : forall A B (f : A -> B) (g : A -> B), f = g 
                   <-> forall (x : A), f x = g x.
Proof.
  hammer'.
Qed.

(* On the other hand, note that the other direction does not hold, because
   if a subtraction on natural numbers underflows, it just returns 0, so
   there are several [x] for which [x-2] returns 0 (namely 0, 1, and 2),
   so it can't have an inverse. *)
Example minus2plus2: ~ inverse (fun (x: nat) => x - 2) (fun (x: nat) => x + 2).

Qed.

(* The identity function is the inverse of itself.
   Note: we're using "@" in front of "id" to say "we want to provide all implicit
   type arguments explicitly, because otherwise Coq would not be able to infer them." *)
Lemma inverse_id: forall A, inverse (@id A) (@id A).
Proof.

Qed.

(* Now we can start proving interesting facts about inverse functions:
   If g is the inverse of f, then [map g] is the inverse of [map f]: *)

Lemma selfComposeComposes {A} : forall (f g: A -> A) (n : nat), fun x => (selfCompose g n) ((selfCompose f n) x) = selfCompose (g ∘ f) n.

(* And here's how to invert the power function: *)
Lemma invert_selfCompose{A: Type}: forall (f g: A -> A) (n: nat),
    inverse f g ->
    inverse (selfCompose f n) (selfCompose g n).
Proof.

(** ****** Optional exercises ******  *)

(* Everything below this line is optional! *)

(* You've reached the end of the problem set. Congrats!
 *
 * If you're up for a completely optional additional challenge,
 * try defining a left-biased merge function below that merges two
 * binary tries, preferring map entries from the first binary trie
 * when an entry exists for both binary tries. Then prove
 * [lookup_left_biased_merge], which formally states that lookups
 * on the merged binary trie operate in exactly this manner.
 *
 * If you don't want to complete this additional challenge, you
 * can just leave everything below unmodified.

Proof.
Admitted.


(* And here are a few more optional exercises about [fold]: *)

(* [fold] is a higher-order function that is even more general
 * than [map]. In essence, [fold f z] takes as input a list
 * and produces a term where the [cons] constructor is
 * replaced by [f] and the [nil] constructor is replaced
 * by [z].
 *
 * [fold] is a "right" fold, which associates the binary operation
 * the opposite way as the [fold_left] function that we defined
 * in lecture.
 *)
Fixpoint fold {A B : Type} (b_cons : A -> B -> B) (b_nil : B)
         (xs : list A) : B :=
  match xs with
  | nil => b_nil
  | cons x xs' => b_cons x (fold b_cons b_nil xs')
  end.

(* For instance, we have
       fold plus 10 [1; 2; 3]
     = 1 + (2 + (3 + 10))
     = 16
 *)
Example fold_example : fold plus 10 [1; 2; 3] = 16.

(* Prove that [map] can actually be defined as a particular
 * sort of [fold].

    map f xs = fold (fun x ys => cons (f x) ys) nil xs.
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Since [fold f z] replaces [cons] with [f] and [nil] with
 * [z], [fold cons nil] should be the identity function.
 *)
Theorem fold_id : forall {A : Type} (xs : list A),
    fold cons nil xs = xs.
Proof.
Admitted.

(* If we apply [fold] to the concatenation of two lists,

Proof.
Admitted.

(* Using [fold], define a function that computes the

Proof.
Admitted.


(* The following two theorems, [sum_append] and [all_append],
