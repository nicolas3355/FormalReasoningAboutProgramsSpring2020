Require Import Frap Pset10Sig.

(* Programmers who start programming with threads and locks soon realize that it
 * is tricky to avoid *deadlocks*, where thread #1 is waiting to take a lock
 * held by thread #2, and thread #2 is waiting to take a lock held by thread #3,
 * and... thread #N is waiting to take a lock held by thread #1.  That's a wait
 * cycle, and none of the threads will ever make progress.
 *
 * The most common wisdom about avoiding deadlocks is to impose a *total order*
 * on the locks.  A thread is only allowed to acquire a lock that is *less than*
 * all locks it currently holds.  In this pset, we formalize a simple static
 * analysis checking that the total-order rule is obeyed, and we prove that any
 * program accepted by the analysis avoids deadlock. *)

(* Please start by reading the definitions in Pset10Sig.v! *)

(* Before diving into the proof hacking, it might be helpful to write a short
   sample program (in Coq) where thread 1 acquires lock 1 and then lock 2,
   while thread 2 tries to acquire lock 2 and then lock 1, and explain (in
   English) how a deadlock can happen: *)

Example bad: prog. Admitted.

(* FILL IN explanation here *)

(* And now, explain why the total-order rule would reject your example by copy-pasting
   the one rule which rejects it from Pset10Sig.v and briefly describing how it would
   reject it: *)
(* The two questions above are not graded, but we hope they help you understand
   the material better! *)
