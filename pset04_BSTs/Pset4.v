(** * Correctness of Binary Search Trees (BSTs) *)

(* Here we prove some correctness theorems about binary search trees (BSTs),
 * a famous data structure for finite sets, allowing fast (log-time) lookup,
 * insertion, and deletion of items. (We omit the rebalancing heuristics needed
 * to achieve worst-case log-time operations, but you will prove the correctness
 * of rotation operations these heuristics use to modify the tree.)
 * In this problem set, we show that insertion and deletion functions are
 * correctly defined by relating them to operations on functional sets. *)

(* We will study binary trees of natural numbers only for convenience.
   Almost everything here would also work with an arbitrary type
   [t], but with [nat] you can use [linear_arithmetic] to prove
   goals about ordering of multiple elements (e.g., transitivity). *)
Local Notation t := nat.

(* Trees are an inductive structure, where [Leaf] doesn't have any items,
 * whereas [Node] has an item and two subtrees. Note that a [tree] can
 * contain nodes in arbitrary order, so not all [tree]s are valid binary
 * search trees. *)
(* (* Imported from Sig file: *)
Inductive tree :=
| Leaf (* an empty tree *)
| Node (d : t) (l r : tree).
*)
(* Then a singleton is just a node without subtrees. *)
Definition Singleton (v: t) := Node v Leaf Leaf.

(* MOST IMPORTANT DEFINITION: *)
(* [bst] relates a well-formed binary search tree to the set of elements it
   contains. Note that invalid trees with misordered elements are not valid
   representations of any set. All operations on a binary tree are specified
   in terms of how they affect the set that the tree represents. That
   set is encoded as function that takes a [t] and returns the proposition "[t]
   is in this set". *)
Fixpoint bst (tr : tree) (s : t -> Prop) :=
  match tr with
  | Leaf => forall x, not (s x) (* s is empty set *)
  | Node d l r =>
      s d /\
      bst l (fun x => s x /\ x < d) /\
      bst r (fun x => s x /\ d < x)
  end.
(* ^MOST IMPORTANT DEFINITION^ *)

(* [member] computes whether [a] is in [tr], but to do so it *relies* on the
   [bst] property -- if [tr] is not a valid binary search tree, [member]
   will (and should, for performance) give arbitrarily incorrect answers. *)
Fixpoint member (a: t) (tr: tree) : bool :=
  match tr with
  | Leaf => false
  | Node v lt rt =>
    match compare a v with
    | Lt => member a lt
    | Eq => true
    | Gt => member a rt
    end
  end.

(* Here is a typical insertion routine for BSTs.
 * From a given value, we recursively compare the value with items in
 * the tree from the root, until we find a leaf whose place the new value can take. *)
Fixpoint insert (a: t) (tr: tree) : tree :=
  match tr with
  | Leaf => Singleton a
  | Node v lt rt =>
    match compare a v with
    | Lt => Node v (insert a lt) rt
    | Eq => tr
    | Gt => Node v lt (insert a rt)

(* [delete] searches for an element by its value, and removes it if it is found.
   Removing an element from a leaf is degenerate (nothing to do) and
   removing the value from a node with no other children (both Leaf) can be done
   by replacing the node itself with a Leaf. Deleting a non-leaf node is
   substantially trickier because the type of [tree] does not allow for a Node
   with two subtrees but no value -- merging two trees is non-trivial. The
   implementation here removes the value anyway, and then moves the rightmost
   node of the left subtree up to replace the removed value. This is equivalent
   to using rotations to move the value to be removed into leaf position and
   removing it there. *)
Fixpoint delete (a: t) (tr: tree) : tree :=
  match tr with
  | Leaf => Leaf
  | Node v lt rt =>
    match compare a v with

    { rewrite <-H0; trivial. }
    { rewrite H0; trivial. } }

(* You may want to call these tactics to use the previous lemma. *)
(* They are just a means to save some typing of [apply ... with]. *)

(* If you are comfortable with it, [eapply bst_iff] followed by careful
 * application of other [bst] facts (e.g., inductive hypotheses) can
 * save typing in some places where this tactic does not apply, though
 * keep in mind that forcing an incorrect choice for a ?unification
 * variable can make the goal false. *)

(* It may also be useful to know that you can switch to proving [False] by
 * calling [exfalso]. This, for example, enables you to apply lemmas that end in
 * [-> False]. Of course, only do this if the hypotheses are contradictory. *)

(* Warm-up exercise: rebalancing rotations *)
(* Transcribe and prove one of the two rotations shown in [rotation1.svg] and [rotation2.svg].
   The AA-tree rebalancing algorithm applies these only if the annotations of relevant
   subtrees are in violation of a performance-critical invariant, but the rotations
   themselves are correct regardless. (These are straight from
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_tree#Balancing_rotations.) *)
(* Each one can be written as a simple non-recursive definition
   containing two "match" expressions that returns the original
   tree in cases where the expected structure is not present. *)

(* To prove [bst_delete], you will need to write specifications for its helper
   functions, find suitable statements for proving correctness by induction, and use
   proofs of some helper functions in proofs of other helper functions. The hints
   on the course website provide examples and guidance, but no longer ready-to-prove
   lemma statements. For time-planning purposes: you are not halfway done yet.
   (The Sig file also has a rough point allocation between problems.)

   It is up to you whether to use one lemma per function, multiple lemmas per
   function, or (when applicable) one lemma per multiple functions. However,
   the lemmas you prove about one function need to specify everything a caller
   would need to know about this function. *)
